# Reinforcement Learning Environment Project

## Description
This project is designed to demonstrate the implementation of a Q-learning algorithm with a simple reward matrix. The environment and Q-learning methods allow the agent to learn optimal actions to maximize rewards based on given states.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy

## Usage
To execute the reinforcement learning algorithm, run:

```bash
python run_reinforcement_learning.py
